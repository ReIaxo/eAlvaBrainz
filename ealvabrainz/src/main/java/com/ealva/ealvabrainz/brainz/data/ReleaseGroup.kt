/**
 * A release group, just as the name suggests, is used to group several different [Release]s into a
 * single logical entity. Every release belongs to one, and only one release group.
 *
 * Both release groups and releases are "albums" in a general sense, but with an important
 * difference: a release is something you can buy as media such as a CD or a vinyl record,
 * while a release group embraces the overall concept of an album -- it doesn't matter how many
 * CDs or editions/versions it had.
 *
 * When an artist says "We've released our new album", they're talking about a release group.
 * When their publisher says "This new album gets released next week in Japan and next month in
 * Europe", they're referring to the different releases that belong in the above mentioned
 * release group.
 *
 * MusicBrainz automatically considers every release in the database to be part of a release group,
 * even if this group only contains the one release. When a brand new release is added to the
 * database, a new release group is automatically added as well.
