   * the company was closed or purchased, or both) example: RCA Red Seal
   * * one of the "production" types:
   *     * "original production": should be used for labels producing entirely new releases example:
   *     Riverside Records
   *     * "bootleg production": should be used for known bootlegs labels (as in "not sanctioned by
   *     the rights owner(s) of the released work") example: Charly Records
   *     * "reissue production": should be used for labels specializing in catalog reissues example:
   *     Rhino
   *  * "distributor": should be used for companies mainly distributing other labels production,
   *  often in a specific region of the world example: ZYX, which distributes in Europe most jazz
   *  records in the Concord Music Group catalog.
   * * "holding": should be used for holdings, conglomerates or other financial entities whose main
   * activity is not to produce records, but to manage a large set of recording labels owned by them
   * example: Concord Music Group
   * * "rights society": A rights society is an organization which collects royalties on behalf of
   * the artists. This type is designed to be used with the rights society relationship type rather
   * than as a normal release label. example: GEMA
