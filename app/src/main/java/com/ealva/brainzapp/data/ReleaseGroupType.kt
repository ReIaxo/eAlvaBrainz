   * ## Primary types
   * * **Album**
   * An album, perhaps better defined as a "Long Play" (LP) release, generally consists of previously unreleased material (unless this type is combined with secondary types which change that, such as "Compilation").
   * * **Single**
   * A single has different definitions depending on the market it is released for.
   * * **EP**
   * An EP is a so-called "Extended Play" release and often contains the letters EP in the title. Generally an EP will be shorter than a full length release (an LP or "Long Play") and the tracks are usually exclusive to the EP, in other words the tracks don't come from a previously issued release. EP is fairly difficult to define; usually it should only be assumed that a release is an EP if the artist defines it as such.
   * * **Broadcast**
   * An episodic release that was originally broadcast via radio, television, or the Internet, including podcasts.
   * * **Other**
   * Any release that does not fit or can't decisively be placed in any of the categories above.

  /**
   * ## Secondary types
   * * **Compilation**
   * Compilation should be used in addition to, not instead of, other types: for example, a
   * various artists soundtrack using pre-released music should be marked as both a soundtrack
   * and a compilation. As a general rule, always select every secondary type that applies. A
   * compilation, for the purposes of the MusicBrainz database, covers the following types of
   * releases:
   *     + a collection of recordings from various old sources (not necessarily released) combined
   *     together. For example a "best of", retrospective or rarities type release.
   *     + a various artists song collection, usually based on a general theme ("Songs for Lovers"),
   *     a particular time period ("Hits of 1998"), or some other kind of grouping ("Songs From the
   *     Movies", the "CafÃ© del Mar" series, etc).
   * * **Soundtrack**
   * A soundtrack is the musical score to a movie, TV series, stage show, computer game etc. In the
   * specific cases of computer games, a game CD with audio tracks should be classified as a
   * soundtrack: the musical properties of the CD are more interesting to MusicBrainz than the data
   * properties.
   * * **Spokenword**
   * Non-music spoken word releases.
   * * **Interview**
   * An interview release contains an interview, generally with an artist.
   * * **Audiobook**
   * An audiobook is a book read by a narrator without music.
   * * **Audio drama**
   * An audio drama is an audio-only performance of a play (often, but not always, meant for radio).
   * Unlike audiobooks, it usually has multiple performers rather than a main narrator.
   * * **Live**
   * A release that was recorded live.
   * * **Remix**
   * A release that primarily contains remixed material.
   * * **DJ-mix**
   * A DJ-mix is a sequence of several recordings played one after the other, each one modified so
   * that they blend together into a continuous flow of music. A DJ mix release requires that the
   * recordings be modified in some manner, and the DJ who does this modification is usually
   * (although not always) credited in a fairly prominent way.
   * * **Mixtape/Street**
   * Promotional in nature (but not necessarily free), mixtapes and street albums are often
   * released by artists to promote new artists, or upcoming studio albums by prominent artists.
   * They are also sometimes used to keep fans' attention between studio releases and are most
   * common in rap & hip hop genres. They are often not sanctioned by the artist's label, may lack
   * proper sample or song clearances and vary widely in production and recording quality. While
   * mixtapes are generally DJ-mixed, they are distinct from commercial DJ mixes (which are usually
   * deemed compilations) and are defined by having a significant proportion of new material,
   * including original production or original vocals over top of other artists' instrumentals.
   * They are distinct from demos in that they are designed for release directly to the public and
   * fans; not to labels.
